# Texture To Server 

I need to make computation on image coming from Quest 3 Camera API on LAN or distance PC

Flask Server: https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_06_13_QuestFlaskServerColor32


----------------

To Do:
- Save the current image left and right to double image and single join image lr
  - Make a lot of image db to test on with shader, job system and compute shader in aim to do test without having to put the headset
- Explore the position from pixel position
- Try to push Texture to Flask server to use opencv install on PC using Color32 bytes export.
